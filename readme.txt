Easily add a log out link or button to a post or page using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

There are 3 shortcodes that can be used:

`[logout]` - A standard Log Out link, where the user stays on the login screen after being logged out.
`[logout_to_home]` - A link that logs the user out, and redirects them to your home page.
`[logout_to_current]` - A link that logs the user out, and redirects them back to the current page/URL.

**Advanced Usage:**

All 3 shortcodes all support 3 attributes/parameters:

`[logout text="" class="" redirect=""]`

The 3 supported attributes/parameters are:

`text=""`
- The text to use for the link anchor text.
- Default: `Log Out`
`class=""`
- The HTML class(es) to use for the link. Multiple classes should be separated by a space.
- Default: `logout`
`redirect=""`
- The path/URL to redirect the user to after they are logged out.
- Default: the WordPress login screen.
- Note: must be a URL or path on the same domain name as the WordPress website (cannot be an external domain/URL)

**Some Examples:**
`[logout text="Log Off"]` - A `Log Off` link that logs the user out.
`[logout redirect="/members/"]` - Log the user out, and redirect them to `/members/`.
`[logout_to_home text="Log Off"]` - A `Log Off` link that logs the user out and redirects them to your home page.
`[logout class="log-out-link"]` - Use a custom CSS/HTML class name for the log out link.


Note: the shortcodes will return nothing/empty if the user isn't logged in.
